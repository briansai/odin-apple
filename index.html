              The 24-inch iMac is a testament to the power and efficiency the M1
              processor provides. Apple moved from the bulky-aging iMac chassis
              to an 11.5mm thin slab of aluminum with whisper-quiet fans. The
              4.5K display with a slim bezel and colorful design will make your
              desk pop with Apple's new style.

              Rumors indicate that the "iPhone 14" could remain nearly identical
              to the iPhone 13, but the mini model will be swapped for a
              6.7-inch iPhone Max. New designs, processors, and cameras may be
              reserved for the pro lineup as Apple further differentiates
              between entry and premium models.
